* Problem Statement (REAL-WORLD)

Most people do not track where their money is going, which leads to:
Overspending
Poor monthly budgeting
Low savings
No clarity on essential vs non-essential expenses
~ Without proper tracking, it becomes difficult to:
Understand spending patterns
Control unnecessary expenses
Make informed financial decisions

* Objective of the Project
The main objective of the Expense Tracker project is to:
Track and store daily expenses in a structured way
Categorize expenses (Food, Rent, Travel, etc.)
Analyze spending patterns over time
Identify high-expense categories and unnecessary spending
Support better budgeting and financial planning
